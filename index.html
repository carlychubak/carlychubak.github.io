	<p>Carly Chubak was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. She has a degree 
	in Physics & Astrophysics (with Honors) from UC Berkeley and is 
	now studying Fine Art at Art Center College of Design.  
	She is currently focused on soft sculpture and textile/fiber installations.  
	Her experience in scientific data analysis informs her art in subtle ways, 
	including an emphasis on the minutiae and on repetitive work, particularly 
	in her use of stitching.</p>
