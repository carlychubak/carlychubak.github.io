In Transposed, Carly Chubak explores the translation of information between systems, and the manipulations that occur during this process.  Chubak shifts between sound, visual language, and 3-dimensional form, using Charles Louis Hanonâ€™s iconic piano technique exercises, Le Pianiste Virtuose (1873), as a starting point.  Sheet-music is converted into lace knitting charts, which are then hand knit into soft panels, while the monotonous sound of the artist playing each piano exercise mirrors the abstracted patterns that appear.  Chubak embodies the data and its movement across mediums as she engages in these repetitive, compulsive tasks.  Any changes or mistakes in the pattern are disjunctures, determining which information is kept, lost, or altered.  Labor becomes a direct affirmation of human agency.
