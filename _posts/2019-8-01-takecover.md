Carly Chubak’s “Take Cover” is a modern revival of the domestic propaganda for American 
households during World War II. Looking back on the fragmented depiction of enemy bodies 
in wartime imagery and the propagandistic call to hand-knit socks for American troops, 
she is fascinated by the way the nation’s agenda pervades the domestic space. In her work, 
Chubak creates a twin-sized quilt that imitates Universal Camouflage Pattern, a US Army 
uniform pattern that will be completely phased out by this September after dramatic failure 
in the field. Each color is hand-dyed using natural dyes including tea from her kitchen 
cupboard. “Take Cover” explores both the impressive complexity of modern imaging science 
and the tragedy of an army wasting billions of dollars on useless uniforms in an effort 
to keep up with the Joneses.
