Noisy Sock, a collaborative piece between Acceptable Risk LA members Sean Cully and Carly Chubak, 
is a collaboration with the environment where it is installed.  When installed on the beach, it 
becomes a solid bobbing mass, filled with a stiff sea breeze.  When installed on a small sloped 
lawn in Highland Park, it becomes listless, only occasionally rising to its full potential.  Noisy 
Sock asks the audience to consider their surroundings.
