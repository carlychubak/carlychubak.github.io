2019\. Cotton muslin, thread, 2 hour performance. 5.9’ x 9.3’ x 4.7’ in situ at U-Kleistpark (U7), 10781 Berlin.

(on) the road (again) explores the ambiguity of language and meaning in personal and communal history.  
Chubak uses two traditional quilt blocks ("On the Road to California" and "On the Road to Berlin") 
to create a mesmerizing repetitive pattern.  The piece, which resembles floor tiles at skewed perspectives, 
has been created specifically to fit the site of the Vitrine at U-Kleistpark (U7), which is passed by hundreds 
every day.  It will hang from each side wall, ultimately creating a U-shape--however, the middle seam will be left 
undone until a the piece in installed.  The two sides/quilt blocks (California and Berlin) will be hand sewn
together in a durational performance during <i>B-LA Connect</i>, June 2019.  The title references three classics: <i>The 
Road</i> by Cormac McCarthy, <i>On The Road</i> by Jack Kerouac, and "On The Road Again" by Willie Nelson.
