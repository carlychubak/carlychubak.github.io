	Carly Chubak was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. She has degrees 
	in Physics & Astrophysics (with Honors) from UC Berkeley and spent several years 
	as a test engineer in the optics industry, analyzing distortion in space-borne 
	telescopes.  Chubak next studied Fine Art at Art Center College of Design, 
	focussing on soft sculptures and textile/fiber installations and graduating as 
	valedictorian in Fall of 2017.  Her experience in science and academia continues to 
	inform her art practice; she focuses on research-based work, an interest in labor, 
	and a feminist perspective. Chubakâ€™s works are heavily analytical, emphasizing the 
	historical and cultural meanings of materials and processes alongside more formal 
	and conceptual concerns.
