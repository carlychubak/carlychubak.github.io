	Carly Chubak was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. She has degrees 
	in Physics & Astrophysics (with Honors) from UC Berkeley and is 
	now studying Fine Art at Art Center College of Design.  
	She is currently focused on soft sculpture and textile/fiber installations.  
	Her experience in scientific data analysis informs her art in subtle ways, 
	including an emphasis on the minutiae and on repetitive work, particularly 
	in her use of knitting and hand stitching.</p>
